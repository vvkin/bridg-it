## Rules
In that game you play against bot with different levels of difficulty. Rules are pretty simple â€” connect adjacent cells without intersection.
Your goal is to build connected line from one side to another. Of course, line direction depends on player color. Red player tries to build
horizontal line and can't connect cells on first and last rows, while blue player builds vertical line and can't connect cells on first and last
columns. The player who is the first to build such a line wins.
